## Implementation Using Interface

In our game, we are using the multiple inheritances using interfaces for the damage and shooting system in our project. For this, first, we have to create an interface called IDamagable & IShootable. But remember if you are making an interface, always the name of that interface will start with I then followed by any name like - IShootable, IDamagable, etc.

Like this -
```C#
public interface IDamagable
    {
      void applyDamage(float damage);
      int currentHealth{get;}
    }
```

```C#
public interface IShootable
  {
    void shootBullets(int bullets);
    int weapon{get;}
  }
```
Now we have created an interface, letâ€™s see how to use it. In order to use it, you have to inherit the interface first and then implement all the methods which are inside it. 

Like this -
```C#
public class EnemyView: Monobehaviour, IDamagable, IShootable
	 {
		  public void TakeDamage(float damage)
      public void TakeBullets(int bullets)
        {
          controller.ApplyDamage(damage);
        }
        
        {
          controller.shootBullets(bullets);
        }
	 }
```
EnemyController -
```C#
public class EnemyController
	 {
				public void ApplyDamage(float damage)
        {
            if (model.health <= 0) return;

            if (model.health - damage <= 0)
            {
                //enemy dead
            }
            else
                model.health -= damage;
        }
        
        public void shootBullets(int bullets)
        {
          if(model.bullets <= 0) retrun;
          if(model.bullets
        }
	 }
```
