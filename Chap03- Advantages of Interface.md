## Advantages of Interface

1. The main advantage of C# interfaces is that they can be used by multiple classes, so instead of calling GetComponent for each script, you can get all the script references by using the interface name
2. Creates common functionality which can be called that doesnâ€™t depend on the object type
3. The interface enables the plug-and-play method
4. Complete Abstraction can be achieved by the implementation of Interface
5. Along with making our code easy to maintain, concept loose coupling can be achieved
